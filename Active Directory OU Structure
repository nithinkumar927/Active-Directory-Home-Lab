Active Directory OU Structure 

This project shows my current Organizational Unit (OU) structure inside Active Directory as part of my Windows Server lab practice.

Overview

I created a structured OU hierarchy to organize users, computers, and servers properly. This helps with:

Applying Group Policies

Managing users by department

Separating workstations from servers

Keeping the domain clean and organized

Domain Name

NK.local

OU Structure
Asia

This is my regional OU.

Inside Asia, I created:

Computers

Laptops

Workstations

Groups

ServiceAccounts

Servers

DomainControllers

Users

Finance

HR

IT

Each department has its own OU to make management easier and more realistic.
