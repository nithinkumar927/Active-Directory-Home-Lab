In this homelab, I set up and configured File Services in a Windows Server environment joined to my NK.local Active Directory domain.

The purpose of this project was to understand how file sharing works in a domain environment, how permissions are controlled, and how storage can be managed using File Server Resource Manager (FSRM).

This lab simulates a real-world company file server setup.

Lab Environment

Domain: NK.local 

Server: Windows Server (File Server role installed)

Client: Windows 10 (domain joined)

Tools Used:

File and Storage Services

Group Policy

File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)

What I Configured
1. Created a Shared Folder

I created a folder:

C:\SHARED


Then I enabled sharing and configured:

Share permission: Everyone – Read

NTFS permissions:

CREATOR OWNER

SYSTEM

Administrators

Domain Users

This allowed controlled access while maintaining security.

2. Mapped Network Drive

On the client machine, I mapped the shared folder as drive:

Z:


Then I configured a Group Policy to automatically map this drive for domain users.

Drive settings:

Location: \ServerName\SHARED

Label: Public Files

Reconnect enabled

3. Installed and Configured FSRM

To manage storage properly, I installed File Server Resource Manager.

From there, I configured:

Quota Management

File Screening

4. Created a Quota

I applied a quota to:

C:\SHARED


Using the template:

10 GB Limit (Hard)


This ensures users cannot exceed allocated storage.

5. Created a File Screen

To prevent misuse of storage, I created a file screen to block:

Audio and Video files


This prevents users from storing large media files on the company file share.

What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

The difference between Share permissions and NTFS permissions

How Group Policy can automate drive mapping

How quotas protect server storage

How file screening prevents unwanted file types

How enterprise file servers are structured

Project Outcome

After completing this lab:

Users can access the shared folder securely

The network drive maps automatically

Storage is limited to 10 GB

Media files are blocked

Everything is managed centrally through the domain

This project helped me better understand real-world Windows Server file management and Active Directory integration.
