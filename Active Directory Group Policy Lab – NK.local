Active Directory Group Policy Lab – NK.local

This lab is part of my Active Directory practice environment where I focused on learning and testing Group Policy configuration in a domain setup.

The goal was simple: understand how GPOs actually work in a real Windows Server environment and see how they affect users and computers inside different OUs.

My domain name: NK.local

What I Worked On

In this lab, I configured multiple Group Policies to control security, user settings, and system restrictions across the domain.

I tested everything using:

Windows Server (Domain Controller)

Windows 10 client machine (domain joined)

Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

Password Policy

I configured a custom password policy inside the domain.

Location:
Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Account Policies → Password Policy

Settings I applied:

Password history: 24 passwords remembered

Maximum password age: 90 days

Minimum password age: 1 day

Minimum password length: 14 characters

Reversible encryption: Disabled

This helped me understand how domain-level password enforcement works and how it affects all users.

Account Lockout Policy

I configured account lockout to improve security.

Location:
Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Account Policies → Account Lockout Policy

Setting:

Account lockout threshold: 5 invalid attempts

If a user enters the wrong password five times, their account gets locked. This protects against brute-force login attempts.

Network Drive Mapping (Z: Drive)

I created a mapped drive policy so users automatically receive a shared folder when they log in.

Location:
User Configuration → Preferences → Windows Settings → Drive Maps

Configuration:

Action: Update

Path: \DC02\Shared Folder

Drive letter: Z:

Label: Public Files

Reconnect: Enabled

When users log in, the shared folder appears automatically as drive Z:.

This was my first time using Group Policy Preferences instead of Administrative Templates.

Desktop Wallpaper Policy

I tested forcing a desktop wallpaper across users.

Location:
User Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Desktop → Desktop

Setting:

Desktop Wallpaper: Enabled

Style: Fill

Once applied, users cannot change their background. This simulates a company-branded desktop environment.

Blocking Control Panel

To restrict user access, I enabled:

User Configuration → Administrative Templates → Control Panel
Policy: Prohibit access to Control Panel and PC settings

After applying this, users could not open Control Panel or Settings. This is useful in managed environments like schools or companies.

USB / Removable Storage Restriction

I also tested blocking USB storage devices.

Location:
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Removable Storage Access

Setting:

All removable storage classes: Deny all access

This prevents users from plugging in USB drives, which improves data security.

What I Learned

GPOs can control almost everything in a Windows domain.

Policies must be linked correctly to the right OU.

User Configuration affects users.

Computer Configuration affects machines.

Running gpupdate /force helps apply changes immediately.

gpresult /r helps troubleshoot when policies don’t apply.

At first, some policies didn’t apply because I linked them to the wrong OU. Fixing that helped me understand how inheritance works.
